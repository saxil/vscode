## Build Size Comparison

| Version | Estimated Size | Memory Usage | Features |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Full VS Code | ~200-300MB | 8GB+ | All features |
| Simple Code | ~100-150MB | 4GB | Essential only |

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Run the build script for your platform:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   build-simplified.bat

   # macOS/Linux
   ./build-simplified.sh
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run watch    # Development mode
   npm run electron # Production mode
   ```

### Installing GitHub Copilot
1. Open Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
3. Install and authenticate with GitHub

### Setting up GitHub Integration
1. Sign in to GitHub via the account menu
2. Clone repositories using Git commands
3. Use the Source Control panel for Git operations

## Customization Options

### Adding Features Back
To re-enable removed features, modify `simpleCodeFeatures.ts`:

```typescript
export const SIMPLE_CODE_FEATURES: ISimpleCodeFeatures = {
    // Change false to true to re-enable
    debugging: true,  // Re-enable debugging
    testing: true,    // Re-enable testing
    // ... etc
};
```

### Removing More Features
To remove additional features, modify `workbench.simplified.main.ts`:

```typescript
// Comment out imports you don't want
// import './contrib/search/browser/search.contribution.js';
```

### Custom Branding
